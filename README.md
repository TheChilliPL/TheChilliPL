Hello, I'm [**Patryk Anuszczyk**][Website] and I'm a 17-year-old programmer from Poland.

Languages I use
===============

C# &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;
---
The language called **C#** with a framework called **.NET Core** is something I've used for years.

Webdev &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;
---
I can create websites using pure **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**, but usually I use **SCSS** because of its convenience.

Kotlin &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;
---
**Kotlin** is a language I've learned not so long ago, but it became one of the most used languages now. I managed to learn it fast because of its similarities to C#. It has a lot of nice and convenient features so coding in it is pure pleasure!

C++ &#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;
---
PHP &#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;
---
Java &#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;
---
I know some **C++, PHP, and Java**, but I don't use these languages that often.

My projects
===========
I don't have too many projects yet, but here are a few I do have:

[TraitorBot](https://github.com/TheChilliPL/traitorbot)
---
A Discord bot written in Kotlin, using [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) Discord API wrapper and [JetBrains Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) SQL Framework. Made originally for playing Among Us, but more features are planned.

[FastCrafting](https://github.com/TheChilliPL/fastcrafting)
---
A simple Spigot plugin allowing you to open Minecraft workbench without placing it in the world!

Smaller things
---
[Discord AMOBlack](https://github.com/TheChilliPL/discord-amoblack)—theme for [BandagedBD](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp) allowing you to text on Discord in the middle of the night without your eyes burning. It's also perfect for AMOLED displays.

Contributions
---
[MassiveDecks](https://github.com/Lattyware/massivedecks)—full Polish translation of the game MassiveDecks based on [Cards Against Humanity][CAH]. Features full Polish declination. (18+)
